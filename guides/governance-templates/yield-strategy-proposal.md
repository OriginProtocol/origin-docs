## Strategy Evaluation

#### Overview

_In a few sentences, how does the protocol work? How do depositors earn yield?_

#### Relationship to Protocol

_What is the relationship between the author of this proposal and the proposed yield protocol?_

### Projected Returns

#### Base APY

_What level of yield can OUSD collateral earn without including liquidity mining incentives? How does it compare to the current OUSD yield strategies? Keep in mind that new strategies often have investment caps of 100k USDC/USDT/DAI._

#### Liquidity Incentives

_What additional yield can be generated from liquidity mining incentives? Are the bonus tokens locked for a period of time?_

#### Total Projected Yield

_Combine the previous two sections in this format, with X as base APY, Y as bonus APY, and Z as the bonus tokens:_

_USDC: XXX% + YYY% in ZZZ_

_USDT: XXX% + YYY% in ZZZ_

_DAI: XXX% + YYY% in ZZZ_

### TVL & Liquidity

_What is the project’s current TVL? Average TVL over the past 90 days? Peak TVL? Include any on-chain reporting, such as Dune queries and DefiLlama pages. If possible, please do not include staking in these numbers._

#### Liquidity

## Project Details

## Security Considerations
