# Bridging

Origin provides users with an innovative and secure way to bridge between Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Base using Chainlink's [Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP)](https://docs.chain.link/ccip)_._ Bridges built using CCIP use arbitrary messaging that triggers an informed action on the receiving smart contract and programmable token transfers to transfer data and tokens in a single transaction. CCIP is built to be highly secure in a scaleable manner and it uses a [Risk Management Network](https://docs.chain.link/ccip/concepts#risk-management-network) to continuously monitor malicious activity.

Origin has been one of the few selected protocols to go live with CCIP on launch as it is poised to become a fundamental piece of cross-chain interoperability. By using the integrated CCIP Bridge from [the Origin dapp](https://originprotocol.eth.limo) or [Chainlink's Transporter app](https://app.transporter.io/), you can seamlessly bridge back and forth between Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Base.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that only Wrapped OETH (wOETH) should be bridged and only the recommended dapps should be used. OETH will not accrue yield if bridged outside of Ethereum and cannot be converted to Super OETH by bridging.
