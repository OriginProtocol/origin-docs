# Overview

Origin Protocol is a suite of complimentary DeFi products designed to increase economic opportunity for all. These permissionless and composable smart contracts provide superior user experiences across DeFi in a groundbreaking multichain yield ecosystem.

Today, Origin consists primarily of four established products:

* [oeth](protocol/oeth/ "mention") - The ideal liquid staking token (LST) that offers a higher yield than its counterparts and a tighter peg to ETH. OETH uses distributed validator technology through SSV to support Ethereum's mission of remaining decentralized and secure.&#x20;
* [ousd](protocol/ousd/ "mention") - The self-custodial stablecoin that earns yield automatically while allowing you to remain fully liquid without the need to lock the funds in a smart contract. It uses sophisticated DeFi strategies to provide continuous and auto-compounded returns.&#x20;
* [arm.md](protocol/arm.md "mention") - Facilitates zero-slippage swapping of redeemable assets by combining AMM features with isolated money markets.
* [Broken link](broken-reference "mention") - Value accrual and governance token for all Origin products. When Origin scales OGN scales as it is the lifeblood of the Origin ecosystem. &#x20;

The Origin core team is fully doxxed and radically transparent. You can contribute to the development of this decentralized protocol by joining the community in [Discord](https://originprotocol.com/discord).
