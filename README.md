# Overview

Origin Protocol is a suite of complimentary DeFi products designed to increase economic opportunity for all. These permissionless and composable smart contracts provide superior user experiences across DeFi in a groundbreaking multichain yield ecosystem.

Today, Origin consists primarily of four established products:

* [oeth](protocol/oeth/ "mention") - the ideal liquid staking token (LST) for protocols
* [ousd](protocol/ousd/ "mention") - the self-custodial, yield-generating stablecoin
* [arm.md](protocol/arm.md "mention") - better pricing for redeemable assets
* [Broken link](broken-reference "mention") - value accrual and governance token for all Origin products

The Origin core team is fully doxxed and radically transparent. You can contribute to the development of this decentralized protocol by joining the community in [Discord](https://originprotocol.com/discord).
