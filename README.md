# Overview

Origin Protocol is a suite of complimentary DeFi products designed to increase economic opportunity for all. These permissionless and composable smart contracts provide superior user experiences across DeFi in a groundbreaking multichain yield ecosystem.

Today, Origin consists primarily of five established products:

* [oeth](protocol/oeth/ "mention") - The ideal liquid staking token (LST) that offers a higher yield than its counterparts and a tighter peg to ETH. OETH uses distributed validator technology through SSV to support Ethereum's mission of remaining decentralized and secure.
* [super-oeth](protocol/super-oeth/ "mention") - The first Supercharged LST offering blended yield from Ethereum's Beacon Chain and L2 incentives. With substantially higher yield and a similar risk profile compared to LSTs, Super OETH provides a safe and sustainable alternative to speculative points games for users seeking to maximize yield on their ETH.
* [ousd](protocol/ousd/ "mention") - The self-custodial stablecoin that earns yield automatically while allowing you to remain fully liquid without the need to lock the funds in a smart contract. It uses sophisticated DeFi strategies to provide continuous and auto-compounded returns.
* [arm.md](protocol/arm.md "mention") - Facilitates zero-slippage swapping of redeemable assets by combining AMM features with isolated money markets.
* [OGN](https://docs.originprotocol.com/ogn) - Value accrual and governance token for all Origin products. When Origin scales OGN scales as it is the lifeblood of the Origin ecosystem.

The Origin core team is fully doxxed and radically transparent. You can contribute to the development of this decentralized protocol by joining the community in [Discord](https://originprotocol.com/discord).
