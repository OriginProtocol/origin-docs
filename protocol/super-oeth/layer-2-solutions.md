# Layer 2 Solutions

Layer 2 solutions on Ethereum are designed to enhance the scalability, speed, and cost-efficiency of transactions without compromising the security and decentralization that the Ethereum mainnet offers. These solutions operate on top of the Ethereum base layer, processing transactions off-chain while periodically settling them on-chain. By doing so, they alleviate congestion on the mainnet and significantly reduce gas fees, making Ethereum more accessible for a broader range of users and applications.

Prominent layer 2 solutions, such as rollups (both optimistic and zero-knowledge) and sidechains, enable thousands of transactions to be bundled and processed in a single transaction on the mainnet. This results in faster confirmation times and drastically reduced transaction costs, which are crucial for DeFi applications and other high-transaction-volume use cases. Additionally, these layer 2 solutions often come with enhanced features, such as improved user experiences, making them an essential component of Ethereum's scalability roadmap.

By leveraging layer 2 solutions, Super OETH can offer compounded rewards and higher yields while maintaining the robust security and decentralization that Ethereum is known for, ensuring a seamless and efficient user experience for token holders.
