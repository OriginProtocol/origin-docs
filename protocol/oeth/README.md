# OETH

Origin Ether (OETH) is a liquid ETH staking token designed to offer enhanced security, higher yield, and a tighter peg to ETH when compared to other LSTs. This is accomplished through rigorous audits, decentralized validator technology (DVT), and a permissionless redemption mechanism paired with deep exit liquidity.

OETH was launched in May 2023 with 95% of its code forked from[ousd](../ousd/ "mention"). This allowed OETH to inherit years of top-tier audits and a proven track record of securing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of underlying collateral. Since growing to over $100 million of TVL itself and being integrated into top protocols such as EigenLayer and Pendle, OETH has transitioned from a yield aggregator to a pure liquid staking token.

In a sea of commoditized liquid staking tokens on Ethereum, OETH stands out with two clear advantages:

1.  **Better risk-adjusted yield**

    OETH earns its liquid staking yield from the Ethereum beacon chain using distributed validator technology (DVT). This provides OETH with an open and simple infrastructure for managing Ethereum validators and presents an opportunity for to earn incentives from DVT platforms, which is harvested and distributed to OETH holders as additional yield.

2. **Tighter peg to ETH**
