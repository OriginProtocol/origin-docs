# Zapper

The OETH Zapper is a convenience contract enabling depositors to use Ether (ETH) to mint OETH. The OETH _Vault_ supports WETH but does not allow direct minting with ETH. This design decision increases security and also reduces the gas costs associated with minting.

### Zapping

The [Origin dapp](https://originprotocol.eth.limo) supports zapping and minting OETH in a single transaction. Users who come to the dapp with ETH will have their transactions automatically routed to the most economically advantageous contract, whether itâ€™s swapping ETH for OETH via Curve or minting OETH by depositing ETH into the Zapper and subsequently WETH into the Vault automatically.

### Withdrawing

The Zapper contract currently only supports depositing, but any OETH minted via the Zapper is still fully liquid. OETH can be redeemed 1:1 for ETH at any time (see [redemption.md](redemption.md "mention") for more details).
