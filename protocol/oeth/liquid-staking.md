# Liquid Staking

Solo ETH staking requires technical expertise, setting up a validator node, and a minimum deposit of 32 ETH. Liquid staking derivatives simplify this by allowing users to stake any amount of ETH and earn yields without running a validator node or meeting the 32 ETH requirement. Users can also withdraw their ETH at any time.

LSTs are becoming more liquid and stable, boosting their importance in DeFi. However, Lido's 75% market share, along with Coinbase and Rocket Pool, creates potential single points of failure, especially under regulatory scrutiny.

To address this, our derivatives use Distributed Validator Technology (DVT), which distributes the validation process across multiple nodes. This reduces the risk of single points of failure and enhances the security and reliability of staking.
