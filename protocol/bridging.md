# Bridging

Origin provides users with an innovative and secure way to bridge between Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Base using Chainlink's [Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP)](https://docs.chain.link/ccip)_._ Bridges built using CCIP use arbitrary messaging that triggers an informed action on the receiving smart contract and programmable token transfers to transfer data and tokens in a single transaction. CCIP is built to be highly secure in a scaleable manner and it uses a [Risk Management Network](https://docs.chain.link/ccip/concepts#risk-management-network) to continuously monitor malicious activity.

Origin has been one of the few selected protocols to go live with CCIP on launch as it is poised to become a fundamental piece of cross-chain interoperability. By using the integrated CCIP Bridge on in the [Origin dapp](https://originprotocol.eth.limo) you can seamlessly bridge back and forth between Ethereum and Arbitrum (Base coming soon).
