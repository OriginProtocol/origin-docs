# Flipper

Flipper is a gas-optimized way for users to swap in and out of OUSD using other stablecoins at a fixed 1:1 rate. This contract may become empty on one side (e.g., contain 0 OUSD balance), and thus sometimes provides limited swap routes. Supported stablecoins include DAI, USDC, and USDT.

While limited in functionality, Flipper uses around 45% less gas than Uniswap v3 due to its simplicity. This provides a more cost-effective swap route for users acquiring or divesting OUSD.
