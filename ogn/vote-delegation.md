# Vote Delegation

There are two main reasons to use vote delegation. First, you may want to delegate your votes to someone who is more technical or is paying more attention to the various proposals being made to the protocol. Second, you may wish to vote on your own, but for convenience delegate your votes to a hot wallet while holding your staked OGN in a safer cold wallet.

You may choose to delegate your voting power for off-chain proposals on the [Origin Protocol Snapshot Space](https://snapshot.org/#/origingov.eth). Choosing this option does not strip you of your voting power. The delegatee receives the extra voting power only on proposals the delegator has not voted on. This is convenient when users want someone they trust or even one of Origin's team members to make governance decisions regarding Origin's ecosystem. It is also useful when users have xOGN stored more safely in a hardware wallet and don’t want to go through the hassle of connecting it to the computer. A more accessible Ethereum wallet (e.g. MetaMask) can be used to vote by having voting power delegated to it from the hardware wallet.

**How to Delegate** (off-chain)

* Go to: [https://snapshot.org/#/delegate](https://snapshot.org/#/delegate).
* Type in the address or ENS name you want to delegate to.
* There is an option to limit the delegation power to only Origin by selecting "Limit delegation to a specific space" and typing in “origingov.eth”.
* Click confirm to save your delegation.Delegating your voting power only for the ousdgov.eth Snapshot space

After completing these steps, the xOGN voting power is successfully delegated to the address specified.

xOGN can be delegated to any address, though you may want to consider delegating to one of the [Recognized Delegates](https://docs.oeth.com/governance/vote-delegation/recognized-delegates).
