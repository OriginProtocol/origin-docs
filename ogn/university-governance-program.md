# University Governance Program

In an effort to increase the decentralization of the network, approved University blockchain organizations will be eligible for a temporary delegation of xOGN tokens to engage in DAO governance. The xOGN provided is expected to be utilized in the voting processes on the [Origin Protocol snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/origingov.eth) and on-chain governance.

To get started, university blockchain organizations may [contact Origin](https://calendly.com/peter-origin-protocol/30min?month=2023-03) for an initial screening call. If approved, Origin will delegate a predetermined amount of xOGN to an Ethereum wallet address controlled by the university blockchain organization.

The tokens delegated to university blockchain organizations can be used for the sole purpose of voting on governance proposals and the participating organizations must commit to acting in the best interests of the protocol. Organizations are also encouraged to propose their own proposals, and can use one of the [templates](https://docs.oeth.com/guides/governance-templates) as a guide.

Schools currently participating in this program can be seen under [Recognized Delegates](https://docs.oeth.com/governance/vote-delegation/recognized-delegates).
