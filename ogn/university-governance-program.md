# University Governance Program

To increase the decentralization of the network, approved University blockchain organizations will be eligible for a temporary delegation of xOGN tokens to engage in DAO governance. The xOGN provided is expected to be utilized to vote on the [Origin Protocol Snapshot space](https://snapshot.org/#/origingov.eth) and on-chain governance.

University blockchain organizations can get started by [contacting Origin](https://calendly.com/peter-origin-protocol/30min?month=2023-03) for an initial screening call. If approved, Origin will delegate a predetermined amount of xOGN to an Ethereum wallet address controlled by the university blockchain organization.

The tokens delegated to university blockchain organizations can be used for the sole purpose of voting on governance proposals and the participating organizations must commit to acting in the best interests of the protocol. Organizations are also encouraged to create their own proposals and can use one of the [templates](https://docs.oeth.com/guides/governance-templates) as a guide.

Schools currently participating in this program can be seen at [recognized-delegates.md](vote-delegation/recognized-delegates.md "mention").
