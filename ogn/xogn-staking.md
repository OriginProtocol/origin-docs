# xOGN Staking

## Why Staking <a href="#why-staking" id="why-staking"></a>

The goal of OGN Staking is to transfer both economic and governance power to those most committed to the long-term success of the protocol.

Origin's products are built for the long term. As such, we need community governance that is similarly focused on the long-term good of the protocol. We incentivize long-term thinking by having users lock Origin Tokens (OGN) for a period of time in exchange for economic and voting power in the form of (xOGN). The longer users choose to stake, the more power they receive. This ensures that power is held by those who are most committed to the long-term success of the protocol. In return for staking OGN, users not only earn the ability to create proposals and vote on the future of the protocol. They are also rewarded with additional OGN derived from protocol revenue. These rewards can be collected at any time.

## Economic & Voting Power Calculation <a href="#economic-and-voting-power-calculation" id="economic-and-voting-power-calculation"></a>

To receive voting power in the form of xOGN, you stake OGN for a duration of your choice between 1 month and one year. You always have the option to withdraw your OGN, though if you do so before your selected lock period ends, you will incur a penalty.&#x20;

The amount of xOGN you receive is based on two factors: the amount of OGN you stake and the end date (expiration) of the lock-up. A multiplier is applied to the OGN amount to calculate the resulting xOGN amount, and this multipler increases according to the length of the lock-up. In other words, the further into the future the end date is, the higher the multiplier. If two users stake the same amount of OGN on different occasions but their lock-up periods end on the same date, they will still receive the same amount of xOGN. The user who stakes earlier will accrue more rewards and be able to exercise her power earlier, but both users will have the same power once they have staked the same amount with the same expiration.

The staking multiplier curve is exponential. The multiplier grows by 1.4x throughout the year. As a result, a 1-year stake will be approximately 4x times larger than a 30-day stake. (1.8 \* 1.8 \* 1.8 \* 1.8 = 10.5). Similarly, a 1-year stake created 4 years from now will be roughly 10.5 times larger in OGV terms than the same stake created now. Extending stakes works similarly. If you extend your stake by a year, you immediately receive a 1.8x multiplier on your veOGV for that stake since the end date has moved forward by a year.

The maximum staking duration is 4 years. The minimum is 30 days.

Over time, the effective power of old stakes is diluted by newer stakes having larger multipliers. When the lock-up period ends, you keep your economic and voting power until you choose to unstake. The way to maximize your power is to stake for the full 4-year period and regularly extend the lock-up period. You can also compound your power by claiming accrued rewards and staking them to increase your veOGV balance.
